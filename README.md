Brackets-Jira
=============

Allows for getting jira issues within brackets

Initial setup is needed by adding site port and login credentials to the user.json file.

*This only performs Jira Gets for all issues relating to you. It does not post information as of yet

Things To Be Added:

- Pop Up for inserting jira credentials if none exist.
- Comments
- Currently only does Jira Get will need to support Post and Post Features
- links take you to the jira site, or in case of email open your email client.
