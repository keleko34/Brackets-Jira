Brackets-Jira
=============

Allows for getting jira issues within brackets

Initial setup is needed by adding site port and login credentials to the user.json file.

This only performs Jira Gets for all issues relating to you It does not post information just yet
working on getting Oauth2 integrated so that is possible.

Things To Be Added:

- Pop Up for inserting jira credentials if none exist.
- Comments
- Currently only does Jira Get will need to support Post and Post Features
- links take you to the jira site, or in case of email open your email client.
